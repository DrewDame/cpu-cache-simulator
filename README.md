# CPU Cache Simulator
This project involved designing a parameterized LC2K cache simulator in C and integrating it into a behavioral processor model to manage unified instruction and data memory. The simulator supports configurable associativity, block sizes, and replacement policies (including LRU and write-back), while logging all memory transfers and cache eventsâ€”providing insight into memory hierarchy behavior, performance tradeoffs, and systems-level interaction.
