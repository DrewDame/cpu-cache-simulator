# CPU Cache Simulator
A parameterized LC2K cache simulator in C integrated into a behavioral processor model to manage unified instruction and data memory. Supports configurable associativity, block sizes, and replacement policies (including LRU and write-back), while logging all memory transfers and cache events to analyze memory hierarchy behavior, performance tradeoffs, and systems-level interaction.
